# DataScience Tutorial for Beginners
I wanted to create a set of hands-on Notebooks for people who would like to become a Data Scientist

Following the instructions of each of these notebooks, student will have a hands-on experience and learn the basics of Data Science. 
I followed the same Learning Path to be one

I have created a Space in Kaggle to run the notebooks, fork them and contribute with more people. 
It is important to contribute and appreciate the contribution of others to make the community stronger

Upvote, Fork and comment each of the notebooks you will use. You will contribute to those sharing knowledge. 
Also, become of us, by sharing your notebooks with others. 

This is my Kaggle Profile with lot of other notebooks: https://www.kaggle.com/pedrociancaglini
